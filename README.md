# 💵 Sales-Analysis-of-a-Supermarket-Chain-with-Recommendations

Portfolio project analysis using SQL and Tableau.

## 📚 About Data

Record of various orders from superstore located in various European countries. 

The file contains data related to orders' volumes, amounts, related products and customers and more.
This dataset contains a csv table with 10.000 records and 20 fields, or variables.

## 💡 Highlights

- Product categories like Binders and Art are most responsive to discounts, generating high quantities sold with minimal discounting needed. 
Focus budget on these categories as they offer high profitability with lower discount rates. 
- Allocate more resources to high-performing subcategories like Copiers and Bookcases, which are driving significant profits. The Tables subcategory, which generates losses, should be assessed critically. 
- Products with high total profitability should be prioritized for scaling, as their overall sales volume leads to strong returns, even if their per-unit profit is lower. Products with low total profitability such as Fellowes File Cart, Single Width should be re-evaluated to improve sales strategy or be considered for phasing out if they do not contribute to overall revenue goals.
